# Backend: School Management Systems 📝

Project is just for practice and learning Nodejs

## Get Started 🚀

First of all initilize the Package.json by _npm init -y_ then first command and write basic code to run the default route ('/'). To update a bit on development side we need to add nodemon to refresh the changes whenever someone update the code (second command). Then we needed to add dotenv package so we can hide some private variables like port and db and other configurations.

### Commands:

    1) npm install express
    2) npm install --save-dev nodemon

## Development 🔥

    1) npm run dev
